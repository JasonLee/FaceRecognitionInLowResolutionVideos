<center><h1>Retina System</h1></center>
<h2>
  This system is used for face recognition from videos/pictures. For low quality videos specifically.
</h2>
<h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  The system is consisted by three parts:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Face Detection</i> to detect and crop all faces in video/picture</li>
      <li><i>Super Resolution</i> to improve quality of images when necessary</li>
      <li><i>Face Recognition</i> to identify each faces</li>
    </ul>
</h2>

  <br>
  Notes for user:
  <ol>
    <li>Before using software, you need to have an 'images' folder (so called recognition database) which contains folders named by identites' names and each one should contains at least one face of that identity.</li>
    <li>There are two ways to run software, import a picture/video or use webcam to record video.</li>
    <li>Please check the setting page before using it.</li>
    <li>You can save detected faces to recognition database by changing their labels (or not) and press ENTER in the text bar.</li>
    <li> A name list of all identities recognized in video will be exported in 'out' folder after recognition.</li>
    <li> Happy Using!</li>
  </ol>
